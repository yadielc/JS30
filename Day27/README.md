<strong>Day 27 - Click Drag and Scroll</strong>

Description:<br>

Today we built an application that allows the user to click a graphic and drag along side.

The concepts reviewed on this session were:

1. JavaScript events
2. Screen coordinate calculation
3. Sliders
4. JavaScript querySelector

Here is a screenshot of the application at runtime:
