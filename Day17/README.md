<strong> Day 17 - Sorting Band names</strong>

On this day, we worked in a small application that would sort the names of bands in an array.
The concepts we reviewed were: document.querySelector, arrow functions, .map(), .sort() among other
concepts of the JavaScript language.

Here is a screenshot of the application at runtime. <br>
