<strong>Array Cardio Day 1</strong>
Description:

On this day we did some exercises on sum data given by Wes on arrays.
We ran some functions on them and did some exercises. We used the functions
map, reduce, filter, among others.

As we were doing this, we did some output to the console to verify the effects
of the functions we applied to the arrays.
