<strong>Array Cardio Day 1</strong><br>

Description:

On this day we did some exercises on sum data given by Wes on arrays.
We ran some functions on them and did some exercises. We used the functions
map, reduce, filter, among others.

As we were doing this, we did some output to the console to verify the effects
of the functions we applied to the arrays.

As extra practice, I invented some related exercises and tried it out myself. By
doing this, I could assess that I understood what Wes was explaining.
This helped me a lot because I am a kinetic learner.

Here are some screenshots of the outputs of the console:
